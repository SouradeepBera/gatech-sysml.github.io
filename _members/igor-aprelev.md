Hi there! I'm a first-year Masters student of Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I'm interested in systems programming, which is why I'm excited to be a part of the Vajra project at SAIL, where we are building an AI inference engine. I graduated with a B.S. in Mathematics-Computer Science from UC San Diego in 2025.
