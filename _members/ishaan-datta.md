Interested in Machine Learning Systems, I am pursuing my Masters at Georgia Tech. I completed my BSc in Computer Engineering from UIUC in 2021, where I worked as a RA/TA under Prof Kalbarczyk at the Coordinated Science Lab (DEPEND). I have 4 YoE, currently as a Data Scientist at Jio Platforms where I work on LLM Inference, and have previously worked at the MIT Media Lab startup Jio Tesseract.
